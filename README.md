# java-language-parser
> A simple compiler for parsing java codes and get syntax errors with CYK algorithm for context free grammars (CFG)

## Documentations
This project were created for a course project. course of `Theory of Language and Automaton`.

This is a very simple parser for `Java Language` resolves by CYK Algorithm for CFGs (Context-Free-Grammars) or better to say, CNFs

This consists of two parsing sections:
  1. Syntax validation : **Success** or **Wrong**
  2. Opening and Closing **parenthesis** - **curly braces** - **brackets**

And no more stuffs.

But it's good to say that it says the location of error, I mean in which line

> For more information about the codes, revert to the codes and read the comments! 

This project has been built with `net beans` IDE.

So if you want, you can easily clone this repository and import it on net beans.
